    <h2>About Brewery Finder</h2>
    <p>
        The Brewery Finder allows users to search for breweries across the United States. 
        You can search by selecting a state, entering a postal code, or both. 
        Additionally, you can filter the search results by the type of brewery, such as microbreweries, brewpubs, or large breweries.
    </p>
    <p>
        After performing a search, a list of breweries will be displayed, each with a link to its location on Google Maps and brewery webpage. 
        This makes it easy to find and visit breweries near you or in specific areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        This app is powered by the OpenBreweryDB, which provides data on breweries across the country.
        openbrewerydb is a Python wrapper for the <a href="https://jrbourbeau.github.io/openbrewerydb-python/ ">Open Brewery DB API</a>. It allows for easy access to brewery data from OpenBreweryDB.
